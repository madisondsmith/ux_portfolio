                A startup, such as seqrpay, must optimize its time and the way it 
                fails in order to succeed. In two and a half weeks, <strong>seqrpay 
                needed a responsive website designed that could clearly inform 
                millennials and small business owners about seqrpay.</strong> 
                Our design team worked with stakeholders - identifying user needs
                and their experiences - to design a responsive site ready for 
                development.

                    <strong>We needed to make a desktop and mobile site</strong> but were provided only a target user and a vague idea of the solution 
                    being offered; that it would have QR tech at its center.
                    Schedules could not be coordinated bewteen design and stakeholders for the first week of this project.
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    <strong>Because we knew little about QR codes, millennials, and the digital wallet environment,
                    the process began by deeply researching these core aspects and how they interact.</strong>
                    I personally have six years of experience in the Food & Service Industry which helped to focus research efforts. 
                    Monica's experience of having been an esthetician was also helpful in understanding a small business perspective.
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    There were two distinct users that would be using the site: the small business owner
                    and the guest of the business; millenials. Thus, <strong>we chose to create two proto personas.</strong> 
                    We then conducted heuristic analyses and general competitor analyses of direct and indirect competitors’ 
                    websites and offerings because we needed to understand
                    how these two users function in similar, existing point-of-sale spaces.
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block"> 
                    Now that we had a clear point-of-departure, we needed to begin empathizing with our users. 
                    Due to my understanding of the industry, inability to coordinate schedules with stakeholders
                    and time contraints of the project, we began immediately developing insights based on research and the 
                    experience of the team members. These insights were needed in order understand what users would be
                    looking for in a site offering a point-of-sale solution
                <!-- 
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    Thus, <strong>preliminary copy was written and tested</strong> with two managers of an established 
                    fine-dining restaurant in downtown Austin, TX. These users tests - plus supplemental customer needs 
                    research from seqrpay startup stakeholders - allowed our design team to understand the language and 
                    needs of the user by way of affinity mapping. <strong>Affinity mapping yielded the following themes: control 
                    and flexibility, fears of mobile point-of-sale systems, security, staff and workflow needs, merchant 
                    needs, and payment processing needs.</strong> Empowered by these insights, grounded in our user-personas and 
                    research, we then needed to hypothesize what kind of site seqrpay and its users needed and well as 
                    the language they spoke.

                        images displayed on the site, accents of color – would all follow suit.

                    our navigation would need to include the logo as a home button, an about us page, a business page, a 
                    consumer page, a how it works page, a login page, and a sign up page. Now we knew what the site would look like.

                    With our design, we got this down to 15 seconds.
                    This was metric for success being that 15 seconds is the statistical amount of time a user will decide to continue reading

                        For example, during the mood boarding process, each member created a board and then 
                        we voted on elements of each board that we then compiled into a single, 
                        synthesized mood board.

                        testing and statstics would inform iterations and decisions leading to

                    experience working with stakeholders on something they really cared about and had already been
                    working very hard on. It involved a ton of research, and detailed design work. However, 
                    designing for multiple user types – small business owner and consumer – was a constant challenge. 
                    Not to mention keeping in mind that we were not developing a soltuion, but instead, we were trying
                    to convey that solution and best organize the exploration of that solution for the two users.
                    Still, because of the incredible team we had, it was managable. Even though we were on a very tight 
                    schedule and we had to spend a lot of time in research and ideation. 
                    Because of our work and dedication to the design thinking process, 
                    we successfully handed off a final product that we knew would convey seqrpay's solution, meet 
                    their user's needs, and that exceeded stakeholder expectations.
