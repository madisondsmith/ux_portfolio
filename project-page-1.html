                            The life of a food truck vendor - of a small business owner - is punctuated by high transaction
                            fees, incompatible ordering solutions, and fragmented payments. <strong>Target users had no way to learn 
                            about how seqrpay solves this problem</strong> for both the small business and their guests. A solution is

                            We needed to make a prototype site in two weeks that would be reponsive across desktop and mobile. 
                            The site would clearly convey seqrpay's solution. We also needed to be designing in a way that 
                            would be optimal for structuring a design system 
                            and in such a way that could be easily passed off to development.

                            We had only two weeks to work 
                            and schedules could not be coordinated between the design team and stakeholders. 
                            We began with very little info about what exactly the site needed to convey.
                            That is, all we really knew is that the solution would somehhow utilize QR 
                            technology 
                            and that it would primarily target food truck owners and millennials.

                            Thus, we conducted a lot of secondary research and relied on our shared

                            the gaps.

                            Thus, we knew that proto-personas would be helpful artifacts to develop.

                    Who will the primary visitor of the site be of our two users? Small business or consumer?

                    Card Sorting would help to answer these questions as well as providing the structure. This would be a critical

                    If they were not able to navigate through the site in a dynamic, yet, funneled way, we could lose potential

                    The "How it works" page, identified from earlier heuristic and competitor analyses, was noted as frequently utilized and key to user 
                    comprehension. 
                    Without this page we would have an incomplete site and confused users 
                    Later user tests would confirm that this page was useful for understanding seqrpay.

                    With structure in place and filled copy and UI we needed to test the full solution. 
                    Earlier in the process we had conducted comprehension testing of individual pages at lower fidelity levels.
                    This is how we were able to perfect the copy as well as gain insights towards how that copy could inform UI.
                    This round of testing focused on the fully-linked, high-fidelity prototype which I'd put together using Figma.

                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align">
                    We focused on testing small business owners. They were revealed as the primary user of 
                    our two possible end-users during card sorting.

                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align"> 
                    We were ecstatic to see results indicating that user comprehension 
                    of seqrpay had improved by 75%. Previously, it was taking as long as one minute for users to comprehend seqrpay.
                    In other words, we got time-to-comprehend down to 15 seconds.
                    This was the chosen metric for success being that 15 seconds is the statistical amount of time a 
                    user will decide to continue reading 
                    or not.

                    This was a an extremely exciting and fun project for me to work on as it provided real 
                    experience working with stakeholders on something they really cared about and had already been
                    working very hard on.

                    It involved myriad research resulting in a fun, infomative, and dynamic design. However, 
                    designing for multiple user types â€“ small business owner and consumer â€“ was a constant challenge.  
                    Not to mention inital lack of scope and keeping in mind that we were not developing a solution, but instead, we were trying
                    to convey that solution and best organize the exploration of that solution for the two users.
                    Still, because of the balanced team we had, it was managable.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    Though we were on a very tight 
                    deadline and we had to spend a lot of time in research and ideation, 
                    we successfully handed off a final product that we knew would clearly convey seqrpay's solution, meet 
                    their user's needs, and that exceeded stakeholder expectations.

                <p class="flow-text">
                    Moving forward, we would would test the live site for usability and begin to do research with actual food trucks 
                    who had been using seqrpay's point-of-sale system. Assessing the confluence of site and actual product would guide us 
                    in seeing where improvements needed to be made regarding the product, how that might affect the site, and where the site 
                    might be lacking â€“ strickly from a design perspective.
