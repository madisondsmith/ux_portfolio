                    People looking for companionship need a trustworthy way of meeting real people online,

                    In todayâ€™s landscape of social media, dating apps, and cultural pressures, 
                    it can be challenging to find the time to meet authentic people that turn 
                    into genuine friends. Why canâ€™t it be like when we were kids? When we could 
                    walk up to someone, ask if they would be our friend, and boom, weâ€™re playing 
                    on the playground.

                <p class="flow-text">
                    First and foremost, we started by learing about our users. 
                    This was done by conducting six user interviews and sending out a survey about how people make new friends.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    We did this because we wanted to understand
                    how people make connections today, what drives them to form friendships, and what tools
                    they use to maintain and grow these friendships.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    From hearing from our six interviewees and reading responses from our 68 respondants 
                    to our 20 question survey, we found that a lot of adults 
                    (77.9% of respondants were age 21-28) really struggle to form friendships â€“
                    especially when doing so online.

                        were related to the beginning moments of meeting someone for 
                        the first time.</figcaption>

                    We also took this time to conduct SWOT analyses

                    Tinder, Hinge, the nudge, and Peanut. 
                    Specifically relevant, while learning about our biggest competitor Bumble BFF, 
                    it was found that digital friend-finding apps saw spikes in use 
                    with the advent of COVID-19. Bumble had seen a 25% 
                    increase in usage. This let us know there was certainly a need for our product.

                    WHRL does it for the user with the icebreaker questions (a precursor to actually being in the 
                    Whirlpool) which are based on your personal profile.

                    For our testing plan, we asked users to perfrom
                    four tasks: create an account, create a WHIRL profile, 
                    jump into a "Whirlpool," and finally, select and send an event to the 
                    "Whirlpool." All testers had 100% success rate in completing 
                    these tasks.

                    Though we had 100% success in task completion, we were able to identify areas
                    that needed refinement. Mainly, we learned that we needed to clarify 
                    UX copy, how buttons are used, and create the option to choose between group 
                    or 1-on-1 "Whirlpools."

                    The outcome of this case study can best be measured for me on a personal level. Had the team continued
                    into further sprints or utilization of the posits herein for existing friend-finding apps, 
                    I'm sure we would have some great real-world impacts to measure.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    In fact, one impact that myself and
                    the team were particularly curious about was the ehtical implications of something like this.
                    We recognized it could be a prime target for abuses. How might we identify and mitigate
                    abuses as such? Another, to better understand some of the psychology
                    behind certain insights and driving factors would have been great to come back to as well;
                    interviewing professionals in human behavior.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    All in all, this case study impacted me first because it was a problem that was so 
                    connected to the very fundementals of how people do what they do in regard to being social.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    Lastly, I was impacted in the sense that it really solidified the relationship 
                    between the core tools and methodologies of the design thinking process. Having to come up with an
                    idea from scratch and see it through in a way that is factual and based in real needs of real people, to me,
                    is the magic and skill of what UX Designers and Researchers can accomplish. 
                    It also taught me to challenge my own assumptions and to recognize when an assumption 
                    has been made in the first place. This case study is one that made me a better designer.
