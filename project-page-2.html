                Solving problems can come about in many ways. For this particular project
                it started with brainstorming from each member's personal perspective.

                ideate solutions, prototype the potential solution, and then test that solution

                        walk up to someone, ask if they would be our friend, and boom, we’re playing

                    First and foremost, <strong>we started gathering data from six interviews and a survey.</strong>
                    At the core of our questioning for both interviews and surveys: we wanted to understand
                    how people make connections today, what drives them to form friendships, and what tools
                    they use to maintain and grow these friendships. By having answers to these questions we
                    might help otherwise lonely individuals meet another – leading to a lasting friendship.

                    to our 20 question survey, <strong>we found that a lot of adults 
                    (77.9% of respondants were age 21-28) really struggle to form friendships</strong> –
                    especially when doing so online. Digital friend-finding apps saw spikes in use 
                    with the advent of COVID-19. <strong>Competitors, like Bumble, had seen a 25% 
                    increase in usage.</strong>

                    through a social app or site. Of that same group, 55.2% of respondants indicated that the hardest
                    parts of making a new friend were related to the actions of maintaing the friendship. While the other
                    44.8% indicated that the hardest parts were related to the beginning moments of meeting someone for

                    have indicated some of their responses. Themes of <strong>trust, fear, and activities</strong>
                    were prevelant. We bagan seeing a little confirmation of the hypothesis that first contact was
                    most difficult because of the identified themes. If this were true then our app would need to

                    We still needed more. With our current understanding, we could more effectively empatize with our

                    "can be vulnerable when [they] trust someone." So, we were dealing with a user that has concerns
                    about meeting for the first time. They just needed to be able trust; no simple task.

                        From research findings and analysis, we then codified general
                        <strong>user insights</strong> about the three main themes operating in concert in regards
                        to <strong>friendship, trust, fear, and activities.</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Trust and fear</strong> were found to be in mutual opposition considering users were
                        <strong>intentionally</strong> seeking a friend. They wanted to trust but
                        also feared other users being inautientic in wanting to establish genuine
                        friendship.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The third theme of <strong>activities</strong> would act as the host of what users hold dear;
                        what they would share with another user. The bonds of friendship would act as
                        a foundation and catalyst for trust particulary when they are a primary feature
                        of first contact.

                    At this point, we were primed to shift from the ideational toward the actual development 
                    of the features.
                    However, we needed to ground what those features would look like in WHRL. 
                    A <strong>user journey and a user flow</strong> were helpful here.

                    <strong>SWOT analyses</strong> of Bumble BFF and Meetup, we were able to get a grasp

                        jump into a "WHIRLpool," and finally, select and send an event to the

                    The outcome of this case study can best be measured for me on a personal level. Had the team continued
                    into further sprints or utilization of the posits herein for existing friend-finding apps, 
                    I'm sure we would have some great real-world impacts to measure. In fact, one impact that myself and
                    the team were particularly curious about was the ehtical implications of something like this.
                    We recognized it could be a prime target for abuses. How might we identify and mitigate
                    abuses as such? Another, to better understand some of the psychology
                    behind certain insights and driving factors would have been great to come back to as well;
                    interviewing professionals in human behavior.
                    All in all, this case study impacted me first because it was a problem that was so 
                    connected to the very fundementals of how people do what they do in regards to being social.
                    Secondly, I was impacted in the sense that it really solidified the relationship 
                    between the core tools and methodologies of the design thinking process. Having to come up with an
                    idea from scratch and see it through in a way that is factual and based in real needs of real people, to me,
                    is the magic and skill of what UX Designers and Researchers can accomplish. 
                    It also taught me to challenge my own assumptions and to recognize when an assumption 
                    has been made in the first place. This case study is one that made me a better designer.
