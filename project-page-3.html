                Our main mission was the improvement of core user flows. In this case, efforts were aimed at Walmart's e-commerce platform.
                Specifically, the team focused on how users signed-in, added items to their cart, and 
                checked out. 
                The question from here became: 
                Whom exactly was the user we should be targeting for flows as such? What pains, if any, were they experiencing? How might we 
                improve the confulence of these flows overall and, thus, improve the user experience?
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                On the one hand, we began performing usability testing 
                to examine the interaction of users with the product and core flows in question. 
                On the other, we began 
                researching to gain general understanding of the business and its users.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                At first, the scale felt huge. We were working on the scale 
                of Walmart, after all. The users that frequent the site vary â€“ to say the least.
                We needed to choose the right target user lest user impact fall flat.
                Moreover, we wanted to aim for a user that would best scale with Walmart's vision regarding the vision for platform growth.

                    Former head of Walmart's e-commerce platform, Marc Lore, had joined Walmart in 2016. 
                    He convinced Walmartâ€™s board to shift its product area 
                    focus from books, electronics, and toys to apparel, food, and everyday essentials.
                    Lore wanted Walmart to become a more universal marketplace. Moreover, under his lead, 
                    UI was improved, free deliveries for orders over $35 began being offered, and the ability 
                    to save money through the BOPIS (buy online pickup in store) initiative.

                    Why did this matter to us? Because all of 
                    these efforts were targeting millennials due to their combined spending of $600 billion/ 
                    year and their making 54% of purchases online. Nielson Norman discussed how there has
                    been a significant change in consumer behavior brought about by the pandemic. 
                    They describe this shift in consumer behavior as the "omnishopper" and it would be sustained 
                    by Gen Z as they continue to enter the workforce. Lastly, Gen Z statistically shares many 
                    of the same views, values, and habits as millennials.

                    I also decided that the three items on which

                    Sarah represents a large customer segment. Someone who manages a home,

                    platform that will succeed. At this stage, Walmartâ€™s main competitor is Amazon. 
                    If they had any hope of competing, it needed to become easier for Sarah to sign in,

                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align flow-text">
                    I helped to develop a three-step design strategy to meet deadlines and achieve Walmartâ€™s 
                    goal of site singularity so as to ensure Sarah would no longer be wasting time.
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align flow-text">
                    First, we needed to centralize the two carts.
                    Having two carts to navigate and toggle between doesnâ€™t 
                    make sense for Sarah and in our testing led to 50% cart abandonment alone from confusion.
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align flow-text">
                    Next, Sarah needed to know what items were available, from where, 
                    and what collection methods were applicable. What good is it to add 
                    toilet paper for pickup only to later find out your preferred store is out of stock? 
                    And seeing all available collection methods â€“ increased system visibility â€“ would make 
                    clear exactly how she would be receiving each item in her cart.  
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align flow-text">
                    The last step would be giving the ability to edit during checkout.
                    Previously this was something that could not easily be done. 
                    Sarah needed to be able to quickly edit her cart during checkout 
                    to make sure her order is exactly what her family needed.

                        Along with the three-step strategy, milestones and deadlines were tracked. A Kanban Board was used to delegate weekly tasks.

                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align flow-text">
                    Now we needed to begin visualizing what solutions could look 
                    like that would also match Walmartâ€™s current branding and style guide. 
                    Each member sketched proposed solutions to each of our three strategies. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align flow-text">
                    What were we really conveying, though? Sketches needed to increase system visibility 
                    for Sarah. This was especially important for what we referred to as collection methods. 
                    Between all the options available to the omnishopper, it needed to be more clear 
                    what methods were available. Of the methods offered by Walmart, a user needed to 
                    know exactly which of the bunch were available for a given product â€“ every time.
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-righthand-block left-align flow-text">
                    The solution for increased system visibility was originally situated in the core flow 
                    in which a user is adding items to their cart. It proved to be useful for other aspects of our three 
                    core flows. For example, when editing a previously selected collection method from your cart, this same 
                    modal was still applicable. This took a lot of stress off our timeline in terms of development.

                                which is equivalent to "Add to cart."

                    We were delighted to find that, with our redesign, users now navigated two tabs without issue; 
                    one for proper display of local store options and the other which would encompass the full inventory 
                    of what Walmart has to offer. All the while, the same UI would be used, the same modals, and the same location 
                    for carts and checkout; effectively mitigating confusion which was previously leading to cart abandonment.

                    Steve Krug, says that the job of good design is to get rid of the 
                    question marks. When search became unified, it just made sense; when you had one 
                    location to which all items went, it just made sense; when users had the control 
                    to choose their collection method from the entire list of available methods for a 
                    particular item, it just made sense.

                    Again, here, we are correlating success with not getting frustrated while moving 
                    through the three core flows. Basically, no confusion equated to no abandonment considering 
                    other more common abandonment reasons (such as limited payment options) were not observed as being an issue 
                    for Walmart.

                    If Walmart implemented our design solutions the impact would be significant. 
                    The results of our testing and prototyping have shown that if users could easily 
                    build their cart they would be less likely to abandon that cart.  Therefore, 
                    Walmart stands to decrease the amount of users abandoning their carts. 
                    This 
                    alone would significantly impact Walmartâ€™s bottom line. Walmart could gain an 
                    additional 35% profit; a possible windfall of $8.5 billion.

                    For future iterations and next steps, we would weigh the actual cost of redesign 
                    implementation, test new solutions with users lost to poor UX, and finally, 
                    we see a lot of opportunity on the logistical side of things. Understanding 
                    the real impact on employees and their workflow is just as critical to Walmartâ€™s 
                    overall success as Sarahâ€™s now improved experience.
