                    <strong>1Our main objective was the improvement of core flows.
                    By doing this we could provide a way for Walmart's current e-commerce platform to 
                    be more intuitive.</strong>
                    This meant that we needed to first understand how those flows were affecting users.
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch">
                    When asking questions about how something is affecting users, it’s usually a 
                    question of deciding who that user is. In this case, we were working on the scale 
                    of Walmart. The users that frequent the site are various. We could’ve selected a 
                    handful and made several different personas but this would add unnecessary complexity 
                    to an already complex project.
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch">
                    So we had to do two things: on the one hand we needed to perform usability testing 
                    to examine login, purchasing of three items, and payout. On the other hand, we needed 
                    to research and decide who our target user would be.

                    Marc Lore joined Walmart in 2016. He convinced Walmart’s board to shift its product area 
                    focus from books, electronics, and toys to apparel, <strong>food, and everyday essentials.</strong> 
                    He wanted Walmart to become a more universal marketplace. Moreover, under his lead, 
                    UI was improved, free deliveries for orders over $35 began being offered, and the ability 
                    to save money through the BOPIS (buy online pickup in store) initiative.
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    <strong>Why did this matter to us?</strong> Because all of 
                    these efforts were targeting millennials due to their combined spending of $600 billion/ 
                    year and their making 54% of purchases online. Nielson Norman discussed how there has
                    been a significant change in consumer behavior brought about by the pandemic. 
                    They describe this shift in consumer behavior as the "omnishopper" and it would be sustained 
                    by Gen Z as they continue to enter the workforce. Lastly, Gen Z statistically shares many 
                    of the same views, values, and habits as millennials. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    All this in mind, I made the call to focus our efforts with this research as our impetus. 
                    <strong>We would target the millennial omnishopper.</strong> 
                    I also decided that the three items on which 
                    we would focus would be the same three that Marc 
                    Lore had convinced the board to adopt as their new product area focus.

                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    With a target user, we could begin conducting usability testing.

                    During research we also wanted to get a feel for how our target user shopped in general online.
                    So we conducted seven 1-on-1 interviews. <strong>These results allowed us to fine tune our understanding
                    of what is going through a person's mind while they shop online or in-person.</strong>
                    This understanding
                    would be reflected later in our sketched solutions.

                        From testing Walmart’s current site, <strong>we learned that their current e-commerce
                        platform was confusing to our target.</strong> This was particularly surprising considering 
                        this was the March 2020 redesigned site. Seven usability tests indicated that the 
                        redesigned Walmart site still felt like two separate sites since the user had to 
                        switch between two pages; a symptom Walmart had tried correcting with the March redesign. 
                        <br><br>There was basically one site for groceries and another for everything else. 
                        And the "everything-else" 
                        site included non-perishable groceries. The two pages also did not look the same in 
                        design or layout and have different UI and functionality causing further confusion.

                        "Walmart" at the top and options narrow inventory are found below.</strong> This is a simple
                        shift, but implies that everything there-below belongs to Walmart whereas before it was split

                        <strong>Sarah represents a large customer segment.</strong> Someone who manages a home, 
                        and whose busy lifestyle is prompting her to increase her purchases online 
                        out of convenience and necessity. She’s a 36 year old wife and mother of 2 . While her 
                        husband must leave home for work, she’s working from home now due to the pandemic 
                        and has the added responsibility of managing her kid’s virtual schooling and 
                        continuing to run their house. She’s stretched thin with little opportunity 
                        to be out and about doing errands, and is searching for an alternative. 
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        <strong>Online shopping is supposed to be a breeze and for Sarah using Walmart’s site it was not.</strong>
                        All e-commerce platforms are vying for the same customer segments, and it is the intuitive 
                        platform that will succeed. At this stage, Walmart’s main competitor is Amazon. 
                        If they had any hope of competing, it needed to become easier for Sarah to sign in, 
                        add several items to her cart, and checkout.

                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    Our team hypothesized a three-step design strategy to achieve Walmart’s 
                    goal of site singularity so as to ensure Sarah would no longer be wasting time.

                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    First, we needed to centralize the two carts. 
                    Having two carts to navigate and toggle between doesn’t 
                    make sense for Sarah and in our testing led to 50% cart abandonment alone from confusion.  
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    Next, Sarah needed to know what items are available from where 
                    and what collection methods are applicable. What good is it to add 
                    toilet paper for pickup only to later find out your preferred store is out of stock? 
                    And seeing all available collection methods – increased system visibility – would make 
                    clear exactly how she would be receiving each item in her cart.  
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    The last step would be giving the ability to edit during checkout. 
                    This is something that could not be easily done previously. 
                    Sarah needs to be able to quickly edit her cart during checkout 
                    to make sure her order is exactly what her family needs.

                        Out of these sketches, I decided which we would move forward with and began 
                        converting the hand sketched solutions into digital wireframes in 
                        Figma where we could easily flesh out elements as we went along as 
                        well as to create prototypes with which we would test our solutions.

                        <br>
                        With wireframed solutions for each step in the flow done, 
                        I connected them to make a low-fidelity prototype which we could test. 
                        This prototype would follow a user signing in, adding eggs to their basket 
                        via the search bar, and viewing those eggs in their basket.

                        The main goal 
                        of this level of prototyping would be to see how the hallmark solution – displaying 
                        all available collection methods – would come off to users on a basic level.

                    <strong>We were delighted to find that with our redesign users navigated between the two 
                    tabs without issue.</strong> Steve Krug, says that the job of good design is to get rid of the 
                    question marks. When search became unified, it just made sense; when you had one 
                    location that all of your items went to, it just made sense; when users had the control 
                    to choose their collection method from the entire list of available methods for a 
                    particular item, it just made sense. This is the kind of impact that Sarah needed. 
                    Something that just worked. <strong>We saw total usability success go from 60% to 84%.</strong>

                    If Walmart implemented our design solutions the impact would be significant. 
                    The results of our testing and prototyping have shown that if users could easily 
                    build their cart they would be less likely to abandon that cart.  Therefore, 
                    <strong>Walmart stands to decrease the amount of users abandoning their carts.</strong>
                    This 
                    alone would significantly impact Walmart’s bottom line. Walmart could gain an 
                    additional 35% profit; a possible windfall of $8.5 billion.

                    <br>
                    For future iterations and next steps, we would weigh the actual cost of redesign 
                    implementation, test new solutions with users lost to poor UX, and finally, 
                    <strong>we see a lot of opportunity on the logistical side of things. Understanding 
                    the real impact on employees and their workflow is just as critical to Walmart’s 
                    overall success as Sarah’s now improved experience.</strong>

                    On a personal note, <strong>this project helped me to understand the timing, coordination, 
                    and pragmatism needed when implementing solutions on this scale</strong> – being able to 
                    work both the design and development side of a problem from start to finish in 
                    just 3 weeks emphasized the need for strong communication and understanding 
                    between and of every role that touches or will touch a given project.

            As the <strong>UX Designer for the seqrpay startup</strong>,
            I worked with a design team of four and stakeholders
            during this two-week sprint to create their first RWD website
            and design system for mobile and desktop.
