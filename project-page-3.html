                A startup, such as seqrpay, must optimize its time and the way it 
                fails in order to succeed. In two and a half weeks, seqrpay 
                needed a responsive website designed that could clearly inform 
                millennials and small business owners about seqrpay. 
                Our design team worked with stakeholders - identified user needs
                and their experiences - to design a responsive site ready for 
                development.

                        The life of a food truck vendor - of a small business owner - is punctuated by high transaction
                        fees, uncompatible ordering solutions, and fragmented payments. <strong>Target users had no way to learn 
                        about how seqrpay solves this problem</strong> for both the small business and their guests. A solution is 
                        nothing unless it can be understood.

                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    The process began by researching - deeply - the nuances of the food truck industry, 
                    QR codes, millennials, the digital wallet environment, and mobile point-of-sale systems. 
                    All of these are core aspects of what seqrpay’s solution is built upon. Amidst this research, 
                    we began conducting heuristic analyses of direct and indirect competitors’ websites and offerings. 
                    It became critical to ensure that we would be grounding our efforts, thus, two proto personas were 
                    developed: one for the consumer or guest and one for the food truck owner or small business owner. 
                    These personas - coupled with our research, heuristics and competitor analyses - would become our 
                    point-of-departure and would be invaluable as we bagan empathizing with potential users. 
                    This empathy would be critical for formulating abstract ideas which would ultimately become the 
                    concrete website. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-stretch-mid-right-block">
                    Thus, preliminary written copy was tested with potential users such as two managers of an established 
                    fine-dining restaurant in downtown Austin, TX. These users tests - plus supplemental customer needs 
                    research from seqrpay startup stakeholders - allowed our design team to understand the language and 
                    needs of the user by way of affinity mapping. The affinity map yielded the following themes: control 
                    and flexibility, fears of mobile point-of-sale systems, security, staff and workflow needs, merchant 
                    needs, and payment processing needs. Empowered by these insights, grounded in our user-personas and 
                    research, we then needed to hypothesize what kind of site seqrpay and its users needed and well as 
                    the language they spoke.

                        The central focus of this project was clearly conveying seqrpay’s solution. 
                        If we could do this, the other arguable foci – adoptability, comprehension, garnering trust, 
                        images displayed on the site, accents of color – would all follow suit. 
                        So, <strong>in a word, the focus of this project was...words.</strong>

                        We found that word choice surrounding mobile point-of-sale systems in the service industry was 
                        polarizing. One challenge we were facing was the damage that early mobile point of sale systems 
                        had done. For example, “mobile point-of-sale” was all that one interviewed manager needed to read. 
                        After that, nothing else of the site’s copy was read.

                    Ultimately, we decided that <strong>users needed something readable</strong> like a brochure-style site that 
                    could provide a high-level understanding of seqrpay <strong>but also something fun</strong>, allowing for 
                    deeper exploration that would also serve to keep the site from becoming stagnant as is 
                    typical of true brochure sites.
                    By final rounds of testing (specifically for comprehension), we found that users’ <strong>comprehension 
                    of seqrpay improved by 75%</strong>; previously taking as long as one minute for comprehension down to 15 
                    seconds. 15 seconds being the statistical amount of time a user will decide to continue reading

                    First we needed to figure out structure of the information architecture. Thus, <strong>card sorting was conducted</strong> and showed the need 
                    for a navigation that would include the logo as <strong>a home button, about us link, a business link, a 
                    consumer link, a how it works link, and login and sign up options.</strong> This sorted navigation would 
                    inform the development of the homepage and all external pages; the entire site.

                    In order to flesh out these pages in a meaningful and grounded way, <strong>we implemented 
                    feature identification and prioritization methodologies.</strong> Finally, we moved into

                    psychologically received by millennials - the target user.
                    Iterating on this round of testing led to the final hi-fidelity prototype and overall seqrpay design system.

                        the site began to emerge naturally which we could then iterate upon and test as we planned 
                        to move into higher fidelity versions of the site.

                        Preliminary UI decisions were made in the same way. 
                        For example, during the mood boarding process, each member created a board and then 
                        we voted on elements of each board that we then compiled into a single, 
                        synthesized mood board.

                        again on how we would proceed. After the intial votes for sketching, 
                        testing and statstics would inform iterations and decisions leading to 
                        the final high-fidelity site prototype.

                    working very hard on. It involved a ton of research, and detailed design work. However, 
                    designing for multiple user types – small business owner and consumer – was a constant challenge. 
                    Still, it was managable considering the amount of time that we spent in research
                    and ideation. Because our work and dedication to the design thinking process, 
                    we handed off a final product that we knew would convey seqrpay's solution and that exceeded
